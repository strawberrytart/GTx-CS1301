#Write a function, called lucky_sevens, that takes in one
#parameter, a list of integers, and returns True if the list
#has three '7's  in a row and False if the list doesn't.
#
#For example:
#
#  lucky_sevens([4, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7, 7, 3, 4]) -> True
#  lucky_sevens([4, 7, 7, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 3]) -> False
#
#Hint: As soon as you find one instance of three sevens, you
#could go ahead and return True -- you only have to find it
#once for it to be True! Then, if you get to the end of the
#function and haven't returned True yet, then you might
#want to return False.

Method 1: 
def lucky_sevens(a_list):
    n=0
    i=0
    found=False
    while i<len(a_list) and not found:
        if a_list[i]==7:
            n+=1
            if n==3:
                found=True
                return True
        else:
            n=0
        i+=1
    return False

Method 2: 
def lucky_sevens(a_list):
    count=0

    for i in a_list:
        
        if i==7:
            count+=1
        else:
            count=0
            
        if count==3:
            return True
    return False 
 
 Method 3: Converting List to Strings
 def lucky_sevens(a_list):
    
    #map() takes two arguments: a function and a list. It returns
    #a new list created by applying that function to each item in
    #that list:
    
    a_list_as_strings = map(str, a_list)
    
    #So, this effectively duplicates the code in the comment above,
    #but without changing a_list. It applies the function str() to
    #each item in a_list, and returns a list of the results.
    #
    #Then, we can check if "777" is in the result of joining that
    #list of strings:
    
    a_list_as_one_string = "".join(a_list_as_strings)
    return "777" in a_list_as_one_string

    #All of which could becompressed down to one line:
    #return "777" in "".join(map(str, a_list))
            

           
#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print: True, then False
print(lucky_sevens([4, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7, 7, 3, 4]))
print(lucky_sevens([4, 7, 7, 2, 8, 3, 7, 4, 3]))
